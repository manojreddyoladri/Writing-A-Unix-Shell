# Writing-A-Unix-Shell
Building an own (non fully functional) shell 

▪ A shell is a user interface for access to an operating system's services
▪ User (or client) issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text
(command lines)
▪ The shell is just another program provided by the operating system
  • You can install additional shells, and make your own.
  • For example DOS, bash, ksh, csh, Powershell etc
▪ Sometimes a shell provides its own programming or scripting language
  • Has its own syntax, operators to control command execution
  • e.g., | (pipe), > (output redirector), < (input redirector), conditional ||, && statements etc.
